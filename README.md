# Early_warning_system
This project focuses on building a web-based GIS early warning system that tracks deforestation 
and its associated impacts, including human-wildlife conflicts. It uses geospatial data, AI models, 
and open-source tools to detect, monitor, and predict deforestation trends, wildlife movement, and 
vulnerable areas in real-time. The system will output an interactive web platform where users can 
visualize and interact with data layers related to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and conflict zones.
### The Early Warning System aims to:
- Detect and predict future deforestation trends using time series data.
- Provide early warnings for upcoming years to help mitigate the effects of deforestation.
- Visualize deforestation patterns and allow further analysis by leveraging geospatial data.

The project utilizes the LSTM neural network for time series analysis and forecasting of deforestation trends, it also utilises unet model for classificarion and visualization of the forested ares. It further visualizes the resuts on a web based Gis formulated using react js and leafmap. The system is scalable and adaptable to various regions, with an emphasis on providing actionable insights for environmental conservation.

## Essentials
- Python: Main programming language for data processing and model training.
- TensorFlow / Keras: Used for building and training the LSTM model.
- NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing deforestation predictions.
- Scikit-learn: For data scaling and preprocessing.
- Google Colab: For running and experimenting with the model in the cloud.
- Geospatial tools (GIS): Integration with GIS for spatial analysis (Google earth engine, Qgis, ArcGis).

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Postgres (postGis)
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
